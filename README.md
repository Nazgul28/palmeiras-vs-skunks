# palmeiras-vs-skunks

It's a multipage website that was coded with HTML, CSS and jQuery.

I intended to build a static website to show the rivalry between Palmeiras and Corinthians. In the future I'll use Wordpress to have a more detailed website regarding the same theme.

The website contains a fixed header in which I used jQuery to add a new class and do all the changes.

I used 4 breakpoints to make it responsive for mobile (including iPhones), tablet and desktop.

It was a fun project!! Go Palmeiras, always!
